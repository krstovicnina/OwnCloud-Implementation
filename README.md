IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OWNCLOUD SERVICE


Introduction

OwnCloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using a file hosting service, or in other words, a model of computer storage that stores data in logical pools, much like Dropbox or Google Drive. However, the primary difference is that ownCloud is free and open source, meaning that anyone can install and operate it on a private server, without charge. OwnCloud also supports extensions that allow users to perform other activities such as online document editing, contact synchronization and many more, and can be accessed via the web or the applications (desktop, Android, IOS, Windows Mobile) offered by ownCloud itself.

Technology

In this implementation, the technology used is virtualization (VirtualBox). It allows an unmodified operating system with all of its installed software to run in a special environment (virtual machine), on top of the existing operating system. The virtual machine (guest) runs directly on the processor of the host (physical computer), but various techniques are employed to intercept operations that would interfere with it.

Implementation

The implementation is performed on the Linux UbuntuServer 18.04 LTS virtual machine.
